Question 1: Class Attendance using a List You are keeping track of student attendance using a list. Sometimes students may enter their names more than once. Step 1: Create a list called attendance_list with the names: ["John", "Emma", "John", "Ava", "Sophia", "Emma"] Step 2: Print the list to see the attendance. Step 3: Count how many names (including duplicates) are in the list and print the total number.
#Step 1: Create a list called attendance_list with the names:
#["John", "Emma", "John", "Ava", "Sophia", "Emma"]

# Step 1: Create a list called attendance_list with the names
attendance_list = ["John", "Emma", "John", "Ava", "Sophia", "Emma"]
#Step 2: Print the list to see the attendance.
print("Attendance List:", attendance_list)
# Step 3: Count how many names (including duplicates) are in the list and print the total number
total_count = len(attendance_list)
print("Total number of names (including duplicates):", total_count)

Question 2: Unique Attendance using a Set To find out how many unique students attended the class, use a set. A set automatically removes duplicates. Step 1: Convert the attendance_list from Question 1 into a set. Step 2: Print the set to see the unique student names. Step 3: Count and print the total number of unique students.
#Step 1: Convert the attendance_list from Question 1 into a set.
attendance_list = ["John", "Ava", "Sophia", "Emma"]
# Example attendance list
unique_students = set(attendance_list)
#Step 2: Print the set to see the unique student names.
print("Unique students:", unique_students)

#Step 3: Count and print the total number of unique students.
total_unique_students = len(unique_students)
print("Total number of unique students:", total_unique_students)
Question 3: Storing Attendance Permanently with a Tuple A tuple is used when you don’t want the list to change. Let’s store the attendance in a tuple. Step 1: Create a tuple called attendance_tuple with these names: ("John", "Emma", "Ava", "Sophia") Step 2: Print the tuple to display the names.
#Step 1: Create a tuple called attendance_tuple with these names: ("John", "Emma", "Ava", "Sophia")
attendance_tuple = ("John", "Emma", "Ava", "Sophia")
#Step 2: Print the tuple to display the names.
print(attendance_tuple)

Question 4: Count Attendance using a Dictionary You want to count how many times each student attended the class. Step 1: Using the attendance_list from Question 1, create a dictionary where each student's name is a key, and the number of times they attended is the value. Step 2: Print the dictionary to see each student's attendance count.
#create a dictionary to count each students attendance from attendance list
attendance_list = ["John", "Emma", "John", "Ava", "Sophia", "Emma"]
attendance_dict = {}

for student in attendance_list:
    if student in attendance_dict:
        attendance_dict[student] += 1
    else:
        attendance_dict[student] = 1

# Step 2: Print the attendance dictionary
print("attendance_dictionary:", attendance_dict)
