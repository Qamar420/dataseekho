QAMAR TAHIR 

Exercise 1: Comments
Write a program that prints your name and includes both single-line and multi-line comments explaining what each part of your code does.
ANSWER:
# This program prints my qamartahir

# Define a variable to hold my name
my_name = "qamartahir"  # You can replace "qamartahir" with your own name

"""
The print function outputs the value of the variable 'my_name' to the console.
In this case, it will display the name stored in the variable.
"""
print(my_name)  # Print the name to the console

Explanation:
Single-line comments (preceded by #) explain specific lines of code.
Multi-line comments (enclosed in triple quotes """) provide a broader explanation of a block of code.
Exercise 2: Error Identification
Below is a piece of code with some intentional errors. Identify and correct the errors. Explain the type of error for each correction made.

print("Welcome to Python!"

result = 10 / 0              

my_list = [1, 2, 3

print(my_list[3])

ANSWER: 
print("Welcome to Python!"

result = 10 / 0              

my_list = [1, 2, 3

print(my_list[3])
print("Welcome to Python!")  # Corrected

result = 10 / 2  # Changed from 0 to 2

result = 10 / 2  # Changed from 0 to 2

my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Corrected

print(my_list[2])  # Changed from 3 to 2

print("Welcome to Python!")  # Corrected the syntax error

result = 10 / 2  # Changed from 0 to 2 to avoid ZeroDivisionError

my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # Added the missing closing bracket

print(my_list[2])  # Changed index from 3 to 2 to avoid IndexError

Exercise 3: Variable Assignment
# Assigning values to variables
name = "Qamartahir"          # Your name (string)
age = 25                # Your age (integer)
height = 5.7            # Your height in feet (float)
is_student = True       # Whether you are a student (boolean)
# Printing each variable with an appropriate message
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "feet")
print("Are you a student?", is_student)

Exercise 4: Descriptive Variable Names
Rewrite the following code using descriptive variable names:

a = 5
b = 10
c = a * b
print(c)
ANSWER:
length = 5              # Length of a rectangle
width = 10              # Width of a rectangle
area = length * width   # Calculate the area of the rectangle
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)

Exercise 5: Numeric Types and Operations
Perform the following operations and print the results:
Add two integers
Subtract a float from an integer
Multiply a float by a complex number
Divide an integer by zero (observe and write down the error)

ANSWER:


# Adding two integers
int1 = 10
int2 = 5
addition_result = int1 + int2
print("Addition of two integers (10 + 5):", addition_result)

# Subtracting a float from an integer
integer_value = 20
float_value = 5.5
subtraction_result = integer_value - float_value
print("Subtraction of a float from an integer (20 - 5.5):", subtraction_result)

# Multiplying a float by a complex number
float_value = 3.5
complex_number = 2 + 3j
multiplication_result = float_value * complex_number
print("Multiplication of a float by a complex number (3.5 * (2 + 3j)):", multiplication_result)

# Dividing an integer by zero (this will raise an error)
try:
    division_result = integer_value / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero:", e)


Exercise 6: Built-in Functions
Write a program that:
Takes a list of numbers as input from the user.
Uses the abs(), max(), and min() functions to find the absolute values, maximum, and minimum of the numbers.
Prints the results with appropriate messages.
Example input: [-5, 3.2, -1, 0, 12]

ANSWER:

Original list of numbers: [-5.0, 3.2, -1.0, 0.0, 12.0]
Absolute values: [5.0, 3.2, 1.0, 0.0, 12.0]
Maximum value: 12.0
Minimum value: -5.0


Exercise 7: Arithmetic Operations
Create a simple calculator program that:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
Asks the user to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Performs the selected operation and prints the result. Handle division by zero gracefully.

ANSWER:
# Simple calculator program

# Function to perform arithmetic operations
def calculator():
    # Prompt the user to enter two numbers
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Ask the user to select an operation
    print("Select an operation:")
    print("1. Addition (+)")
    print("2. Subtraction (-)")
    print("3. Multiplication (*)")
    print("4. Division (/)")

    operation = input("Enter the operation (1/2/3/4): ")

    # Perform the selected operation
    if operation == '1':
        result = num1 + num2
        print("Result: {} + {} = {}".format(num1, num2, result))
    elif operation == '2':
        result = num1 - num2
        print("Result: {} - {} = {}".format(num1, num2, result))
    elif operation == '3':
        result = num1 * num2
        print("Result: {} * {} = {}".format(num1, num2, result))
    elif operation == '4':
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        else:
            result = num1 / num2
            print("Result: {} / {} = {}".format(num1, num2, result))
    else:
        print("Invalid operation selected.")

# Run the calculator function
calculator()
